** Question ** What are options for producing distributions in R?

** Question ** What is binomial distribution?
	Reference - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWv0RUxDfbs
	
		When looking at a sample size of independent trials/experiments (n), 
		the binomial distribution models the probability (p) of successes or failures. 
		If there’s a test with only two outcomes of pass or fail – and that test is 
		taken 100 times (n) – the probability (p) of the outcome which would be either 
		passing grades or failing grades. 

** Question ** What is poisson distribution?
	Reference - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPOChr_kuQs
	
	Within a certain or fixed amount of time the poisson distribution describes the probability 
	of an event occurring. For example, the number of customers going through a Starbucks drive-through during rush hour? 


** Question ** We’ve covered this before, but now that we are further in the course – what are summary or descriptive statistics?  Why do they matter and when do you use them?

	Looking at data set, description statistics summarize and organize the information. 
	The distribution, central tendency (mean/median/mode), and variability measures are the 
	three main types of descriptive statistics. 
	
	These characteristics or observations about the data can be described quantitatively 
	(using the numbers or percentages) or by using graphs/charts to help summarize and help 
	communicate the analysis.  
	
	This allows us to make decisions based on the data sets and to share our findings 
	in meaningful ways to different audiences.

** Question ** What are correlation and covariance and what methods do you have in R to perform?  How should you visualize correlation and covariance?
	Reference - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJEBxsKDDoE
	
	Correlation and covariance describes the relationship (if any) between two or more variables. 
	Correlation determines how closely two variables are related and covariance determines how much two variables differ from each other. 
	
	In R, we can use different methods.
		cor - calculates correlation (can be used on a numerical matrix)
		cov - calculates covariance or the variance between variables
		GGally package (and the ggpairs function) helps to create visualizations

** Question ** What is a T-Test?
	Reference - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1RFWHV2VUU
	
	A T-Test tests the mean of a set of data or compares the means of two groups to determine the relationship 
	(if any) and the difference between the two. We can use t.test in R to calculate these numbers.

** Question ** What is ANOVA?  How is it used?

** Question ** What is correlation?  What is positive vs negative correlation?
** Question ** What is standardization and correlation coefficient?
** Question ** What is Pearson’s correlation coefficient?
** Question ** What is the significance of the correlation coefficient?
** Question ** What are confidence intervals?
** Question ** What does it mean when there is statistical significance?
** Question ** What are confidence intervals?
** Question ** What is causality and what do we need to be cautious of?
** Question ** What are the two types of correlation?
** Question ** How do we handle missing data?
** Question ** What is Pearson’s correlation coefficient?
** Question ** What are P-Values?
** Question ** How is r² used?  What is it?
** Question ** What is Spearman’s correlation coefficient and when is it used?
** Question ** What is Kendall’s tau? When is it used?
	
	Reference - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D56dvoVrBBE

	Kendall's tau (non-parametric) is a correlation that should be used when the dataset 
	is smaller "with a large number of tied ranks" (p. 225). According to the text, 
	more accurate generalizations can be determined from this correlation versus Spearman's. 
 

** Question ** What is bootstrapping?  When do you do this?
** Question ** What is biserial and point-biserial correlation?
** Question ** What is partial correlation?
** Question ** How do you compare correlations? Why would you do this?
** Question ** How do you calculate the effect size?
** Question ** How do you report correlation coefficients?
